# Call-Reports-of-US-Banks.
This project aims to analyse call report data from US Banks to form a time-consistent series of deposits (demand, brokered, and time), loans (C&I, personal, and real estate loans), and mortgage-backed securities, and analyse their trends across small, medium, large, and very large banks.
